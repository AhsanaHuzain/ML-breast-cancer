# Breast Cancer Classification

This project classifies breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using various machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset contains features from breast cancer tumor samples, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Preprocessing Steps
1. Checked for missing values and duplicates.
2. Handled outliers.
3. Analyzed feature correlations and distributions.

## Models Used
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
3. **Random Forest**
4. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
5. **Decision Tree**

## Results
- **Logistic Regression**: 96% accuracy
- **SVM**: 96% accuracy
- **Random Forest**: 94% accuracy
- **k-NN**: 93% accuracy
- **Decision Tree**: 89% accuracy
